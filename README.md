Everyone wants to start their day off right these days, thus the majority of individuals frequently check the weather report before creating their daily schedule. Although weather predictions are not always accurate, it is nevertheless possible to predict future weather conditions based on prior data using a Machine Learning.

The project illustrates the use of machine learning-based predictive analysis to forecast the likelihood of rain on a given day using the historical data provided. The suggested system will aid in predicting the weather's future trend while taking prior data into account. The likelihood of rain can be determined using this approach, allowing everyone to make arrangements without being confused.
